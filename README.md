# divider
divider plugin for blender

License: GPL v3

# How to use

Download plugin and install it.

You can then click "create divider" on an empty scene and tweak the parameters. The system works based on frames and change geometry as soon as frame change. 
If you close a file and re-open it, you'll need to click "create divider" for it to work again.

The plugin is limited to one divider creation but you can create linked duplicated to have multiple divider in yuo scene. Each one them can be tweak via modifier but the number of iteration and speed will be common to all of them.

You can as well parent another object and use instancer on faces to create dynamique objects moving.

No support will be given.

Feel free to tweak and adapt the code if required.
